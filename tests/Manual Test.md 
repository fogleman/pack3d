##Manual Test Report

Manual tests to run on the nesting algorithm. 
 
**Test 1**
 <COMMAND TO RUN> ` pack3d {100,100,100} 2 output 6 Pika.stl
` 
Observation: Pikacu may go beyond maximum run packing size frame 
Expected: All files packed withing 100,100,100 
Results : Model may go beyond pack size in the X, Y or Z director. And the size out of the frame is about 10 percent of the frame size.

**Test 2** 
<COMMAND TO RUN> `pack3d {40,40,30} 2.0 output 6 lampshade.stl`

Observation: Works well. The output STL is in the frame size. 
Expected: The 6 STLs should be in a frame {25,25,25}.
Results: if I input this frame({25,25,25}), no result can I get, which means the room usage is not that efficient.


**Test 3**
<COMMAND TO RUN> `pack3d {100,100,100} 2.0 output 7 corniere_machine.stl

Obsevation: Works well for this part. If I change the number of STLs, the output will be in the frame if there it can give an output.

**Test 4**
<COMMAND TO RUN> `pack3d {100,100,100} 1.0 output 18 printABS.STL`

Observation: Works well. will not exceed the frame.

**SUMMARY**
Strength: For most case this software will work well.
Weakness: It may not be so efficient as for the room usage.
Opportunity: We may use `binpack` for further improvement.
Threat: For Pika it may exceed the frame. The reason maybe the boundingbox for Pika doesn't include the whole Pika model.
